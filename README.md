This repo contains the samples that demonstrate solution for ebanking payment on Edge.  

Cryptographic hardware such as UKey is deployed as a secure online banking payment at nationl level in China.  This used to be achieved by running ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer provided by all banks.   ActiveX is no longer supported on Edge due to security reasons.  In this sample, we propose a new mechanism to address this issue.  This mechanism mainly contains two parts:  A native app running the functioanlities of the keyboard and certificate ActiveX controls and communicating with Edge through websocket.
